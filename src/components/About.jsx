        Hey! I'm Ilya. I'm 26 years old and I'm from Volgograd, Russia. I have
        been actively engaged in web development for almost 2 years and
        constantly study new technologies and try to apply them. Studied at
        GeekBrains IT University at the faculty "Full Stack JavaScript
        development". <br />
        <br /> I can and love to work in a team. I can organize myself for
        remote work. The experience gained is not just in the treasury of
        skills, but is actively used in product development. I like to learn
        from more experienced colleagues, in addition to self-study. <br />
        <br /> There are already over 35 non-commercial projects on my GitHub.
        Also I plan to improve my skills in the field of mobile development
        using the React Native framework. Also I love making 8-bit games in
        PICO-8 engine (Lua).
